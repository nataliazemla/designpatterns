# Singleton
 => creational design pattern\
 => ensures a class has only one instance\
 => provides a global point of access to that instance\
 => the single instance is commonly used for managing shared resources, configuration setting or logging functionality

 ## EXAMPLE
 Single global instance of a database object throughout an application, so the database object is only created once (the first time it is needed) and then all other clients will use this same object.
